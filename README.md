# liri-node-app

*LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

*LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

*liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

   * `concert-this`

   * `spotify-this-song`

   * `movie-this`

   * `do-what-it-says`

### What Each Command Should Do

1. `node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>`

   * This will search the Bands in Town Artist Events API (`"https://rest.bandsintown.com/artists/" + artist + "/events?app_id=codingbootcamp"`) for an artist and render the following information about each event to the terminal:

     * Name of the venue

     * Venue location

     * Date of the Event

2. `node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'`

   * This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window

     * Artist(s)

     * The song's name

     * A preview link of the song from Spotify

     * The album that the song is from

   * If no song is provided then your program will default to "The Sign" by Ace of Base.

3. `node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'`

   * This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window:

     ```
       * Title of the movie.
       * Year the movie came out.
       * IMDB Rating of the movie.
       * Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.

   * If the user doesn't type a movie in, the program will output data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'

4. `node liri.js do-what-it-says`

     * It should run `spotify-this-song` for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in `random.txt`.

     * Edit the text in random.txt to test out the feature for movie-this and concert-this.
